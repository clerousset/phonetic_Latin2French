# phonetic_Latin2French

A Python module reproducing the phonetic transformation rules from Latin to French.

`latin2french.py` contains the class `Word` with the `transform` method and the `rules` using `regex`

`exemples.py` contains examples of transformation

`caracteres_speciaux.txt` is a remainder of the UTF codes for the special characters needed

At the moment around 15 % of the rules are still missing. 

This projet aims to grow by adding languages. All the indo-european languages could be connected this way

Keywords : Latin, French, phonetic transformation, indo-european languages, diachronic linguistics
